Nervous but excited, the college graduate stepped through the glass doors of her new office on her very first day. She was greeted with warm smiles, a welcome card on her desk, and even a fresh cup of coffee from a teammate. The morning flew by as she met her colleagues and learned about the projects she’d get to work on. By lunch, she felt like she already belonged. Walking home that evening, she couldn’t stop smiling, after years of studing and hard work, she was finally exactly where she wanted to be, starting a career filled with promise.
